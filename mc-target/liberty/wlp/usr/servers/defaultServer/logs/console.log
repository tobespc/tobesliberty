[AUDIT   ] CWPKI0817A: The default SSL configuration expects a <keyStore> element with an id value of defaultKeyStore, and a password. The defaultKeyStore <keyStore> element is missing, or the password is not specified. If SSL is not required, this message can be ignored. If SSL is required, either define the missing element: <keyStore id="defaultKeyStore" password="yourpassword" />, or change the default SSL configuration to use an existing keystore. See the following example: <ssl id="defaultSSLConfig" keyStoreRef="newKeyStore" />.
